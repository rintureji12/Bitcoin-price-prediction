# Bitcoin price prediction

This project deals with predicting the future bitcoin price using machine learning.
Here, I have used **LinearRegression** for building the model.
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. LinearRegression can be used to forecast bitcoin price based on the trends of past years.
